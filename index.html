            <p class="card-text">
              Throughout my 36 years I have wore many hats in different
              industries. During this time I have grew a passion for programming
              technology. My introduction into manipulating HTML came from the
              first faces of social media. For those of us who remember
              "Myspace", you may recall putting a personal touch visually on
              your page required a more personal interaction with HTML coding.
              Although it was a copy and paste job for the most part there was
              the ability for you to understand how the code was styling certain
              elements such as a background or font. I spent countless hours
              destroying the look and feel of my page before getting it to an
              acceptable state for the world to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first interaction with coding that included a paycheck was
              doing sales for a company that had it's own DIY web builder. In
              addition they also offered professional design services. Often
              with these packages customers would settle on a lower design
              package to perserve cost. It was my ability to add on finishing
              touches to enhance the end product which helped me be successful
              in that company. This experience helped lead me to my current
              position. Although I am still in transition to becoming a
              developer my self, I currently work directly with developers of
              all languages as a Business Analyst and Product Owner. I help
              drive the business and process requirements while getting first
              hand details of the technical implementation of these features.
              Through this the DU Coding Boot Camp I inspire to be having my
              hands involed with software implementation sooner than later!
