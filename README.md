# Title:

Device Responsive-Portfolio

# Description:

This small responsive website was a personal project where I wanted leverage screen responsiveness. With Mobile First designs being an absolute standard in the industry today. The purpose of this project was to get an introduction to leveraging a grid system layout with column and rows that respond to an end users screen size for a cohesive experience across the board. This was also an introduction to leveraging the "Bootstrap" elements and tailoring them to my desired look and feel. This three page website has layouts on the about/index and portfolio pages that will stack the elements as the screen width becomes more narrow to keep the flow of usability as a user would expect these days. That also includes the shift of the navigation bar to a hamburger style menu whish also is pretty standard.

# Updates:

Updates to this website include links to my person Linkedin and Github profiles using the designated icon of the respective companies. This web site is now inlcuding information on three projects where the Github API is leveraged to display the project name and repo links. This lates update also includes a PDF file for a recently updated resume.

# Challenges:

Although this was a small website for a beginning developer who is not familiar with grid system I found it challenging to leverage the columns and rows with styling certain artifacts within a given container of space. With testing certain elements individual and together I was able to grasp the concept of division in a given sequence of columns and rows. The second challenge was utlizing Bootstrap elements such as the navigation bar. I improved but will continue to play with these elements as they can be a great asset for a developer that can understand when to leverage existing classes or create new ones for styling these to you individual need.

With this being just a beginning I have a better understanding of dthe grid system and leveraging exising open source code to enhance a given project.
